# CoursePlanner
A Java-based course planner that provided me practice with 2D array manipulation.

Implementation of an automatic course planner via several files:

1. **CoursePlanner.java** - A class featuring two methods for planning, checking and printing various course schedules.

2. **PlanTest.java** - A class featuring a main method along with a generator helper for testing our CoursePlanner class.
